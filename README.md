**Project:** Solo Project built in the 14th week of the CodeClan Course.

<p>Focus Pocus - A handy app that helps to focus and boost productivity, targeted at young individuals</p>

<br/>

## Project Brief:

<h3>MVP:</h3>

A user can:
- Add, edit and delete todos
- Add priority (low, medium or high) to a todo
- Mark a todo as complete/uncomplete
- Filter by all, complete or uncomplete todos
- See how many uncomplete todos are left
- Change the order of todos (Drag & Drop functionality)
- Use a pomodoro timer to better manage the learning process
- Start, pause or reset the pomodoro timer
- Loop work and break sessions
- Hear a bell once work or break session ends
- Play relaxing music in the background

<h3>Extensions:</h3>

A user can:
- Customise the length of work and break session
- Toggle between light and dark app mode

<h3>Future Extensions:</h3>

- Accessibility: an app can support keyboard control. All the interactable components would be highlighted so that user can recognise which element is currently active
